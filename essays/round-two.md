I have worked on a lot of languages after multiple years of classes. Things like Python, Java, Perl, C, C++, Javascript, PHP, HTML, and some I've probably missed. While they tend to blur together in places, I remember Javascript quite clearly. I don't have to worry about type.

No int.

No char.

No str.

It's **liberating.**

Personally I think I'm pretty good at keeping track of my code and being able to keep variables in line. So learning early languages like Java where I have to constantly be aware of the type, or make sure I properly convert them was always a pain. It taught me the importance of typing and keeping tabs of your variables at all times, of course. However, not freaking out over how I get this string to a certain type of number and back again is always welcome.

There's always room for improvement and learning things like ES6 definitely count. Some of the more basic things like const and let were thankfully taught in other classes for things like C and C++, so I'm not unfamiliar with them. The different naming conventions for different structures and formatting may take a little while though. Not typing double quotes is something I have definitely gotten used to and it's hard to not instinctively hit shift before I start a string.

Overall the language seems like it has the potential to be a good software engineering language. It's built to work in things like webpages, so it's already a good starting point for interacting with other applications and services. It's also a seemingly straightforward language compared to some other languages that are more picky that may get in the way of working properly. This could also be seen as a downside depending on how sloppy the code gets. It may be more easy to run into issues in that sense, though that is more human error at that point.
