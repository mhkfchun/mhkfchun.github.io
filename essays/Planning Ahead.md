## So Much To Choose From

There's so much I learned from ICS 314, meaning there's so many choices to pick from in writing about the experiences I've had and the lessons I've learned.

The multitude of new shortcuts and options in coding with javascript and the different frameworks that allow you to do a lot more with a lot less.

The different processes and interactions that go into building a respectable framework and making sure that what you build upon that and what you take away from it are well thought out.

Instead, I decided to go with something a little less code-centric, but something that I'll take away from this class and put towards future projects, computer class or otherwise, well into the future.

I'd like to talk about configuration management and agile project management and how they've changed my perspective on group projects.

## Branching out

PICTURE OF TREE BRANCH (FAMILY TREE-LIKE)

(Introduce Github, talk about open source development and project management. Go over the concept of master and branches and having individual repos and a central repo, push/pull/commits)

## Gotta Go Fast

PICTURE OF DC FLASH OR OTHER FAST THING (CAR, ETC.)

(Talk about agile project management and how faster, less documented, but quicker and immediate results and turn around can be lucrative.)

## Having Issues In A Good Way

PICTURE OF ERROR OR PROBLEM

(Talk about Issue Driven Project Management and the concept of starting with a baseline and naturally adding issues as new problems and requirements arise, to quickly build up a work flow and get things done in a mostly logical order)

## It's All Coming Together

PICTURE OF OH YEAH, IT'S ALL COMING TOGETHER (EMPERORS NEW GROOVE)

(Talk about the combination of Github's branches and project board to keep track of various goals, deadlines, and issues with IDPM in mind)

## Party Of One

PICTURE OF SINGLE PERSON BIRTHDAY PARTY OR IMAGE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL WORK

(Talk about the downsides to this method, the lax control of this project management sytem and how multiple people and constant and frequent communication is especially necessary to make sure people stay on the same page about what's going on and what needs to be done. The fast paced style making it potentially difficult to keep up if different group members are at different tempos.)

## Outside The Box

PICTURE OF OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

(Application outside of software development. Use in other group projects and other real world projects and assignments. Trying to implement branches and into other things when applicable. Using Github more frequently for projects.)
