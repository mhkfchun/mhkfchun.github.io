# Media Meetups

## Overview

*The problem:* With the limited connectivity in the state of Hawaii due to the current Coronavirus situation, we cannot as easily connect and interact with others, let alone those within our classes and campus.

*The solution:* With so many options and possible media outlets currently available, Media Meetups would allow students from UH to search for and find others with similar media subscriptions as theirs and find people interested in watching the same things as them. With ways to search by subscription, series/title, episode number, type of watcher, and whether you've seen it before, you can tailor your viewing experiences as you see fit and meet up with others digitally to watch shows at the same time from the safety of your home.

## Approach
Once a user creates their profile, they would be able to set up a subscription and series/title they are interested in and allow the system to list them as looking for a match for that title.

Users will be able to set up notifications and alert them if someone has shown interest in their listing. Interested users will also be able to browse through the different listings and sort through subscription and series/title for users looking for someone to watch with.

Admins are able to monitor the site, edit or remove listed titles and subscriptions if there are discrepancies, readjust user listings properly, and review and remove users if they are reported for inappropriate behavior.

## Mockup page ideas
* Landing page
* Account creation page
* Home page
* Create listing page
* Edit listing page
* Browse listings page
* View listing page
* Reports page
* Admin browse listing page
* Admin edit listing page
* Admin view listing page
* Admin view Reports page

## Use case ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
* New user goes to landing page, creates an account, logs in, sets up home page
* Existing user logs in, creates their listing, and sets specification and notification settings
* Existing user logs in, uses report page to report a user and list reasons and evidence
* Existing user logs in, browses and sorts through listings page, finds a match, and sends a notification that they're interested
* Admin logs in, views report, decides user has violated the rules and deletes their account and any listings
* Admin logs in, views report, and edits a title name so it is spelled properly

## Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Have students log in using UH CAS to guarantee the students are from UH
* A feedback or rating system for users
* Notification through email/SMS
