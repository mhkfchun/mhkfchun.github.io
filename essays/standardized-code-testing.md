"Work smarter, not harder"

I've heard this quote used frequently during all my years of coding classes and in particular it's one I thoroughly enjoy.

As a less experienced coder, when I had to learn coding standards I sometimes thought to myself, "Why put in all this effort? What does it matter if it got the job done?"

Looking back now, I'm so glad I learned to respect coding standards early. At worse it's a necessary evil. At its best it's a life saver.

## For The Masses

When you're looking at code you shouldn't have to work to figure out what everything does. There's comments, formatting, and all other manner of ways to make it look presentable to someone else. Coding standards are a big part of that. When things become standardized, there's less to "work out". You don't have to second guess their code and can more easily see what the goal was. When everyone's following the same rules, picking up where someone left off speeds things up exponentially.

Sometimes you forget that you're not always making things from the ground up. Perhaps you've been hired to update someone's already existing system. That means you have to work around whatever the other person left behind. Proper coding standards could mean the difference between spending thirty minutes getting the job done, or an hour just trying to figure out what it does in the first place.

## Save Yourself The Effort

Even if it seems like you're taking longer by following the rules, often they're there to cut waste, or make everyone's lives easier. For instance, a simple change from " to ' means you don't need to press the shift key whenever you need quotes. Even larger changes like reducing redundancy or using more direct and literal code means you spend less time typing while getting the same job done.

## Do It For Yourself

We're not perfect beings and neither is our code. Inevitably, something will go wrong and we'll need to backtrack and see what is missing. Just like if anyone else were to read it, if you're not careful, even you may get lost in your own code. The standards are here to help ourselves just as much as they are to help others.

In the same vein of troubleshooting, using things like ESLint while following coding standards can help smooth things out when you're not sure what went wrong. Being able to have the computer tell you that you missed something, or that this variable is never used can nip more simple mistakes in the bud before they become time consuming. That way you have more time to focus on the real complicated problems should you have them.

## Personal Opinions

When I can put a little more effort in to save myself stress in the long run, I'm more than happy to take it. If it means my computer can tell me when I didn't do a good job and how to fix it, then even more so. It's also surprisingly satisfying when you start to catch yourself, even without the computer telling you something isn't right. Not to mention the relief of seeing a visible checkmark, telling you you're good to go. Practice makes perfect and getting used to it means forming good habits. You won't always be able to rely on the computer to do it for you, but until then I've got ESLint.

After all, we work smarter around here.
