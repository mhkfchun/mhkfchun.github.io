## Why software development?
From a young age I had always been fascinated with applications, games, and other types of software that let you create something of your own. Things like old 90's computer programs that let you draw and make interactive slideshows, text document programs that run in the command line, or even languages like Python or Perl. For a long time I had been interested in the simple act of creating, making small programs or games with them. However, I recently started to see the bigger picture and want to learn more. I want to see how to apply what I spent all this time learning.

## What can I learn?
Software engineering seems like it will be a good place to see more practical application for the things I've been learning for all these years. Servers, websites, software, programs, coding, you name it and I've at least dabbled in it in some class or another. Now I get to see how they all come together. From the beginning, just being able to work with javascript, html, and css would be a big start in putting the pieces together.

By the end of this course, I hope to have a better real world understanding of where I am. More experiences overall under my belt, and a platform to hopefully strike out when I'm ready to step out of the school's bubble. As it stands, setting up the different social websites like github and linked.in and other ways to get myself out there is looking to be a big change in what I know of the modern work environment. Still, it's change that's for the better and one I look forward to.

Theres a saying that goes, "If you give a man a fish, he eats for a day. If you teach him how to fish, he eats for a lifetime."
