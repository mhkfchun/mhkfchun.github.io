summary: A mock-up page of the Island Snow home page, recreated using Semantics UI-React running in Meteor.
---

This mock-up page was one of the earlier assignments that taught us how to get familiar with Meteor while using Semantics UI and React. While running Meteor, we were able to view our pages and edit them while seeing those changes in real time. Since we had worked with making mock-up pages with Island Snow before, it allowed us to focus more on what things could be translated over from Semantics-UI and React and what would need to be different. This also helped us get familiar with maneuvering around the project folders a little bit.

</div>

The assignment was helpful in learning the basic structures of a page using Meteor and how to run and setup Meteor regularly, since we'd be using it quite a lot after this point.

If I were to work on this project again, I'd probably actually implementing the buttons to work properly and redirect to different pages. I'd also want to make sure the layout and buttons more closely resembled the website in font and color.
