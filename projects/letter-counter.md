The Letter Counter was made as an assignment to help us both get used to parsing text files as well as learn how reading characters works in C. The program reads the input or text file and checks the character used and updates an array counter accordingly. Finally displaying to the user the number of times the letters are used.

This program was a good learning experience for manipulating characters during a program and how to cheat and apply different characters to be recognized as the same. In this case reading uppercase and lowercase letters similarly. Otherwise it was a good exercise at reading in text and practice with arrays.

If I were to do the program again, I'd like to add more functionality to it by allowing to sort by different parameters. For instance taking in the argument "highest" first would result in the display showing the highest occurrence of a letter in descending order. Some other possibilities could be something like the amount of capital letters or even some symbols for a more complete count of the text.
